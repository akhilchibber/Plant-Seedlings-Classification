Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Plant Seedlings Classification Project. This repository contains a detailed Jupyter Notebook that guides users through the entire process of training a deep learning model for classifying various plant seedlings.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the "V2 Plant Seedlings Dataset," which comprises 5,539 images of crop and weed seedlings at different growth stages, which can be found on Kaggle: [Plant Seedlings Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset). The dataset is richly diverse, containing 12 distinct plant species common in Danish agriculture. Each class consists of RGB images showing plants at various growth stages, making it a perfect dataset for our classification task.

## Project Features
1. **Data Preparation:** Understand your data with comprehensive visualizations.
2. **Model Building:** Leverage a pre-trained ResNet18 model using PyTorch, tailored for the classification task.
3. **Model Training and Validation:** Detailed guidance on training the model with real-time performance feedback.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Techniques to rigorously evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
5. **Result and Visualization:** Tools for analyzing and visualizing the model's predictions.
