## Dataset
This project utilizes the "V2 Plant Seedlings Dataset," which comprises 5,539 images of crop and weed seedlings at different growth stages, which can be found on Kaggle: [Plant Seedlings Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset). The dataset is richly diverse, containing 12 distinct plant species common in Danish agriculture. Each class consists of RGB images showing plants at various growth stages, making it a perfect dataset for our classification task.
